OPEN THE WEBSITE — SIMPLE STEPS
===============================

THE WEBSITE IS ALREADY RUNNING!

Just open your browser and go to:

   http://localhost:3001

   Book a service:  http://localhost:3001/book
   Admin login:     http://localhost:3001/admin
   Login: Svit.uk@hotmail.com  /  123456789

---

IF THE WEBSITE STOPS WORKING:

The server is running in Cursor. If you close Cursor, the website stops.

To start it yourself later:
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to: C:\Users\nicpe\OneDrive\Desktop\Cursor test
3. Run: npm run dev
4. Wait for "Ready"
5. Open http://localhost:3001

OR use the batch file (but you may need to close other servers first).

For full setup guide, see START HERE.txt.
