HOW TO RUN BE BEAUTY BAR (BOOKING SITE)
=======================================

Quick reminder: see OPEN THE WEBSITE.txt for the 3 steps and URLs.

You don't need to know any coding. Just follow these steps.


STEP 1 — Install Node.js (only do this once)
--------------------------------------------
1. Open your web browser and go to:  https://nodejs.org
2. Click the big green "LTS" download button.
3. Run the file that downloads. Click "Next" through the installer.
4. When it's done, restart your computer (or at least close all Cursor/terminal windows).


STEP 2 — Run the app
--------------------
1. Open the folder:  Cursor test
2. Double-click the file:  Run the app.bat

   A black window will open. The first time can take 1–2 minutes.
   Wait until it says "Ready" or "compiled successfully".

   *** KEEP THAT WINDOW OPEN ***
   If you close it, the site stops and you'll get "refused to connect"
   when you try localhost.


STEP 3 — Open the site in your browser
--------------------------------------
1. Only AFTER the black window says "Ready" or "compiled" —
2. Open Chrome, Edge, or any browser.
3. Type in the address bar:  http://localhost:3001
4. Press Enter.

   You should see your booking site!


WHERE TO GO
-----------
• Homepage:     http://localhost:3001
• Book (customers):  http://localhost:3001/book
• Admin (you):       http://localhost:3001/admin

   Log in with:  Email: Svit.uk@hotmail.com   Password: 123456789
   You can change your password after logging in (Admin → Change password).


TO STOP THE APP
---------------
Close the black "Run the app" window. The site will stop. 
To run it again later, just double-click "Run the app.bat" again.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
• "Node.js is not installed"  
  → Do Step 1 above, restart your computer, then try Step 2 again.

• The black window closes straight away  
  → Right‑click "Run the app.bat" → "Open with" → Notepad, and check the file 
    is in the same folder as your project. Or open Command Prompt, type:
    cd "c:\Users\nicpe\OneDrive\Desktop\Cursor test"
    then run:  Run the app.bat

• "This site can't be reached" / "localhost refused to connect"  
  → The server is not running. You must run "Run the app.bat" first.
  → Keep the black window OPEN. Closing it stops the server — then localhost fails.
  → Wait until the black window says "Ready" or "compiled" before opening
      http://localhost:3001   or   http://127.0.0.1:3001
  → If the black window closed: double‑click "Run the app.bat" again, wait for Ready.
  → Quick start (after first setup): use "Start server only.bat" to start just the server.
  → Run "Run the app.bat" by double‑clicking (don't use PowerShell). If you use
    Cursor's terminal: run  cmd /c "npm run dev", then keep that terminal open.

• "EPERM" or "operation not permitted" / Prisma or npm fails during setup  
  → Your project is in OneDrive. Syncing locks files and causes this error.
  → BEST FIX: Move the whole "Cursor test" folder to a location OUTSIDE OneDrive,
    e.g.  C:\dev\beauty-booking  or  C:\Projects\beauty-booking. Then run
    "Run the app.bat" from the new folder.
  → Or: Pause OneDrive sync, close Cursor and all terminals, then run again.
  → Or: Right‑click "Run the app.bat" → Run as administrator.
